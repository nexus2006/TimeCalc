# TimeCalc
Simple web app to locally add and subtract time durations and show time remaining till a deadline.

This was made for pilots to run locally on an EFB (electronic flight bag) to add legs, flight segments, fuel burn times, etc.; and compare a running total to a maximum.

run in a browser by loading index.html

or

run with electron by passing the app directory.
